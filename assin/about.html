        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Our unique atmosphere is what drives guests to visit itsKreamy for breakfast, lunch, and coffee time after time. We have intentionally crafted an inviting space that breaks away from the traditional, stuffy reputation of a specialty 
          breakfast coffee shop. We aim to make everyone feel welcome whether they prefer a high-end brew or a classic cup of Folgers.</p>

       <h3>How We Got Our Name</h3>
       <p>The farmers and their coffee came first, and our name came later. We began purchasing coffee from zcc in 2021 after a partnership was formed with Nobel Peace Prize winner, Rigoberta Menchu. Inspired by <b>KEORAPETSE JONAS</b> who signed in 2022, we originally sold this offering as itsKreamy Coffee. The Peace Coffee name stuck as we continued to
         seek partnerships with farmers and coffee-growing cooperatives in other countries.</p>
